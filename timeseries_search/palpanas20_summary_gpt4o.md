**2. Introduction**
- Data series are widely used across various domains (e.g., audio, finance, scientific data).
- Managing large collections of data series is challenging due to their size and complexity.
- Nearest Neighbor (NN) queries are essential for data series analysis.
- Summarization and indexing techniques are used to manage large collections efficiently.
- The iSAX summarization technique and its indexes represent state-of-the-art solutions.

**3. Background and Preliminaries**
- **Data Series Queries**:
  - Includes basic Selection-Projection-Transformation (SPT) and complex Data Mining (DM) queries.
  - DM queries (e.g., similarity search, clustering) treat the series as whole objects.
- **Data Series Summarizations**:
  - Techniques like SAX, PAA, and DFT reduce dimensionality.
  - Summarizations are key to efficient indexing.
- **Data Series Indexing**:
  - Indexing helps with ad hoc query workloads.
  - Methods like iSAX address the inefficiencies of sequential scans.

**4. The iSAX Family of Indexes**
- **Basic iSAX Index**:
  - Uses SAX representation for dimensionality reduction.
  - Supports approximate and exact similarity searches.
- **Bulk-Loading (iSAX 2.0 and iSAX2+)**:
  - Enables faster index creation by grouping data series.
  - Reduces disk I/O during index building.
- **Adaptive Indexing (ADS, ADS+, ADS-Full)**:
  - Supports answering queries before the index is fully built.
  - Adjusts dynamically to workload.
- **Parallel and Distributed Indexes**:
  - **ParIS and ParIS+**: Leverage multi-core architectures for efficiency.
  - **MESSI**: Optimized for in-memory datasets, achieving interactive query speeds.
  - **DPiSAX**: Distributed indexing for massive datasets using Spark.
- **Variable-Length Index (ULISSE)**:
  - Supports queries of varying lengths with compact representations.
- **Sortable Summarizations (Coconut Family)**:
  - Introduces sortable summarizations for balanced, bottom-up index construction.
  - Improves construction, query speed, and storage efficiency.

**5. Discussion and Open Research Directions**
- Highlights the need for a general-purpose Sequence Management System.
- Explores future directions:
  - Unified indexes combining features like progressive queries, approximate answers, and variable-length support.
  - Application to high-dimensional vector similarity search (e.g., deep learning embeddings).
- Suggests focusing on query optimization and leveraging modern hardware for efficiency.

**6. Conclusions**
- Reviews the iSAX index evolution and its contributions to data series indexing.
- Provides a roadmap for combining features and exploring new opportunities in data series management.
