Facebook AI Similarity Search (Faiss) is an open-source library developed by Meta (formerly Facebook) to efficiently perform similarity searches and clustering on large-scale datasets comprising high-dimensional vectors. Traditional databases are not well-suited for handling the complexity and scale of such data, especially when dealing with billions of vectors generated from multimedia content. 

**Key Features of Faiss:**

- **Versatile Similarity Search Methods:** Faiss offers a range of similarity search techniques, allowing users to balance between speed, memory usage, and accuracy based on their specific requirements. 

- **Optimized Performance:** The library is designed for high efficiency, providing optimized implementations for both CPU and GPU environments. Notably, it includes a state-of-the-art GPU implementation for the most relevant indexing methods, significantly accelerating search operations. 

- **Scalability:** Faiss is capable of handling datasets with billions of vectors, making it suitable for large-scale applications. It has demonstrated performance improvements of up to 8.5 times faster than previous state-of-the-art methods in nearest-neighbor search implementations. 

**Applications:**

Faiss is utilized in various domains requiring efficient similarity searches, including:

- **Image and Video Retrieval:** Identifying and retrieving multimedia documents that are similar to a given query. 

- **Recommendation Systems:** Matching users with content or products based on similarity measures.

- **Natural Language Processing:** Finding semantically similar text documents or embeddings.

**Impact on the Field:**

By addressing the limitations of traditional databases in handling high-dimensional vector data, Faiss has become a critical tool for researchers and engineers working with large-scale similarity search problems. Its open-source nature and optimized performance have facilitated advancements in machine learning applications, particularly in areas requiring rapid and scalable similarity computations.
